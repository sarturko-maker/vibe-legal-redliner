  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Please read this disclaimer carefully before using Vibe Legal Redliner.</strong>
  </div>

  <h2>1. AI-Assisted Development</h2>
  <p>
    This software was built using AI-assisted development tools. While care has been taken
    to ensure quality, the codebase has not been audited by a professional software
    engineering team.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Not Legal Advice</h2>
  <p>
    Vibe Legal Redliner is a document markup tool, not a legal service. Nothing produced
    by this extension constitutes legal advice. No attorney-client or professional
    relationship is created by using this tool.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Human Review Required</h2>
  <p>
    All output generated by this extension must be reviewed by a qualified legal
    professional before use. Do not rely on AI-generated redlines without independent
    human verification.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Warranty on Accuracy</h2>
  <p>
    AI models can and do produce inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading results. The
    extension developer makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy,
    reliability, or completeness of any output.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Not Tested at Scale</h2>
  <p>
    This extension is an early-stage project. It has not been tested across a wide range
    of document types, clause structures, or jurisdictions. Edge cases should be expected.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party AI Dependency</h2>
  <p>
    This extension relies on third-party AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and
    their upstream model providers) for contract analysis. The developer has no control
    over the availability, accuracy, or behaviour of these services.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Flows to Your AI Provider</h2>
  <p>
    When you use this extension, the plain text extracted from your contract is sent to
    the AI provider you select. With OpenRouter, your text passes through OpenRouter and
    then to the underlying model provider. Review each provider's privacy policy before
    processing sensitive documents. See the full
    <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
  </p>

  <h2>8. MIT Licence</h2>
  <p>
    This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
    See the <a href="https://github.com/sarturko-maker/vibe-legal-redliner/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License</a>
    for the full legal text.
