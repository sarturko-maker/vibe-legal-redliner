  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Your .docx files never leave your browser. However, the
    extracted contract text <strong>is sent to your chosen AI provider</strong> (Google Gemini
    or OpenRouter) for analysis. We (the extension developer) never see, store, or have
    access to any of your data.
  </div>

  <h2>What This Extension Does</h2>
  <p>
    Vibe Legal Redliner helps you redline contracts by comparing them against your playbook
    rules using AI. The extension processes your .docx files locally in your browser, sends
    the extracted text to an AI provider you choose, and applies the AI's suggested edits
    as tracked changes back into the document.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> The plain text extracted from your contract is sent to a
    third-party AI provider for analysis. If your documents contain sensitive or confidential
    information, make sure you are comfortable with your chosen provider's privacy policy
    before using this extension.
  </div>

  <h2>How Your Data Flows</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You upload a .docx file. <strong>The file stays in your browser's memory</strong> and is never uploaded anywhere.</li>
    <li>The extension extracts the plain text from the file locally using bundled libraries.</li>
    <li><strong>The extracted text is sent directly from your browser to your chosen AI provider</strong> (Google Gemini or OpenRouter) using your own API key. We are not an intermediary &mdash; the request goes straight from your browser to the provider.</li>
    <li>The AI provider returns suggested edits as structured data (JSON).</li>
    <li>The extension applies those edits as tracked changes to the original .docx file, entirely locally in your browser.</li>
    <li>You download the redlined document to your device.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have no servers that receive your data.</li>
    <li>We do not see your documents, your contract text, your playbooks, or your API keys.</li>
    <li>We do not collect analytics, telemetry, usage data, or personal information of any kind.</li>
    <li>We have no tracking pixels, cookies, or third-party scripts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Is Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The following data is stored in your browser's extension storage (on your device only):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API key</strong> &mdash; stored in Chrome's extension storage. You can choose "session only" mode in Settings so the key is automatically cleared when the browser closes.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong> &mdash; your selected AI provider, model, and display preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom playbooks</strong> &mdash; any playbook rules you create.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>None of this data is transmitted to us or to any third party. You can clear it at any time by removing the extension.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party AI Providers</h2>
  <p>
    When you use this extension, your contract text is sent to the AI provider you select.
    The extension currently supports:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> &mdash; <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">Google's API Terms of Service</a></li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter</strong> &mdash; <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy" target="_blank">OpenRouter's Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You provide your own API key. The request goes directly from your browser to the
    provider. We do not proxy, intercept, or log these requests. The provider's own
    privacy policy and data handling practices apply to the text you send them.
  </p>

  <h2>What Stays Local</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your original .docx file (never uploaded)</li>
    <li>The redlined output document (generated locally)</li>
    <li>All document processing libraries (Pyodide, JSZip, python-docx) are bundled with the extension and loaded locally &mdash; no external CDNs</li>
    <li>Your API key and preferences</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If we change this policy, we will update the date at the top. Material changes
    (such as adding new third-party services) will be noted in the extension's changelog.
  </p>

    If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our
    GitHub repository.
