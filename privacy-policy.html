  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Your .docx files never leave your browser. However, the
    extracted contract text <strong>is sent to a third-party AI provider</strong> for analysis.
    With Google Gemini, text goes directly to Google. With OpenRouter, text goes to
    OpenRouter which routes it to the underlying model provider (e.g. Anthropic, Google,
    Meta). We (the extension developer) never see, store, or have access to any of your data.
  </div>

  <h2>What This Extension Does</h2>
  <p>
    Vibe Legal Redliner helps you redline contracts by comparing them against your playbook
    rules using AI. The extension processes your .docx files locally in your browser, sends
    the extracted text to an AI provider you choose, and applies the AI's suggested edits
    as tracked changes back into the document.
  </p>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> The plain text extracted from your contract is sent to a
    third-party AI provider for analysis. When using OpenRouter, your text passes through
    OpenRouter and then to the model provider hosting your selected model. If your documents
    contain sensitive or confidential information, review the privacy policies of all
    providers in the chain before using this extension.
  </div>

  <h2>How Your Data Flows</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You upload a .docx file. <strong>The file stays in your browser's memory</strong> and is never uploaded anywhere.</li>
    <li>The extension extracts the plain text from the file locally using bundled libraries.</li>
    <li><strong>The extracted text is sent from your browser to your chosen AI provider</strong> using your own API key. With Google Gemini, the request goes directly to Google. With OpenRouter, the request goes to OpenRouter, which routes it to the model provider hosting your selected model (e.g. Anthropic, Google, Meta). We are not an intermediary in either case.</li>
    <li>The AI provider returns suggested edits as structured data (JSON).</li>
    <li>The extension applies those edits as tracked changes to the original .docx file, entirely locally in your browser.</li>
    <li>You download the redlined document to your device.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have no servers that receive your data.</li>
    <li>We do not see your documents, your contract text, your playbooks, or your API keys.</li>
    <li>We do not collect analytics, telemetry, usage data, or personal information of any kind.</li>
    <li>We have no tracking pixels, cookies, or third-party scripts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Is Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The following data is stored in your browser's extension storage (on your device only):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API key</strong> &mdash; stored in Chrome's extension storage. You can choose "session only" mode in Settings so the key is automatically cleared when the browser closes.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong> &mdash; your selected AI provider, model, and display preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom playbooks</strong> &mdash; any playbook rules you create.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>None of this data is transmitted to us or to any third party. You can clear it at any time by removing the extension.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party AI Providers</h2>
  <p>
    When you use this extension, your contract text is sent to the AI provider you select.
    The extension currently supports:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> (direct) &mdash; <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank">Google's API Terms of Service</a></li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter</strong> (routing service) &mdash; <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy" target="_blank">OpenRouter's Privacy Policy</a>.
      OpenRouter forwards your request to the provider hosting your selected model
      (e.g. Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral). That provider's own privacy policy also applies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You provide your own API key. We do not proxy, intercept, or log these requests.
    When using OpenRouter, your text may be processed by both OpenRouter and the
    underlying model provider &mdash; review both providers' data handling practices.
  </p>

  <h2>What Stays Local</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your original .docx file (never uploaded)</li>
    <li>The redlined output document (generated locally)</li>
    <li>All document processing libraries (Pyodide, JSZip, python-docx) are bundled with the extension and loaded locally &mdash; no external CDNs</li>
    <li>Your API key and preferences</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If we change this policy, we will update the date at the top. Material changes
    (such as adding new third-party services) will be noted in the extension's changelog.
  </p>

    If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our
