# Disclaimer

**Please read this disclaimer carefully before using Vibe Legal Redliner.**

## 1. AI-Assisted Development

This software was built using AI-assisted development tools. While care has been taken to ensure quality, the codebase has not been audited by a professional software engineering team.

## 2. Not Legal Advice

Vibe Legal Redliner is a document markup tool, not a legal service. Nothing produced by this extension constitutes legal advice. No attorney-client or professional relationship is created by using this tool.

## 3. Human Review Required

All output generated by this extension must be reviewed by a qualified legal professional before use. Do not rely on AI-generated redlines without independent human verification.

## 4. No Warranty on Accuracy

AI models can and do produce inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading results. The extension developer makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any output.

## 5. Not Tested at Scale

This extension is an early-stage project. It has not been tested across a wide range of document types, clause structures, or jurisdictions. Edge cases should be expected.

## 6. Third-Party AI Dependency

This extension relies on third-party AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and their upstream model providers) for contract analysis. The developer has no control over the availability, accuracy, or behaviour of these services.

## 7. Data Flows to Your AI Provider

When you use this extension, the plain text extracted from your contract is sent to the AI provider you select. With OpenRouter, your text passes through OpenRouter and then to the underlying model provider. Review each provider's privacy policy before processing sensitive documents. See the full [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.html) for details.

## 8. MIT Licence

This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. See the [MIT License](LICENSE) for the full legal text.
